What is a Data Structure / Algorithm ?

- A datastructure is a specific way of organizing , storing , and accessing data.
- A set of instructions that tells a computer how to do something , or we can also say step-by-step solution of the problem is called algorithm.

#BIG O Notation

Big O Notation helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run (time complexity)
or
how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows (space complexity).


O(n)

- Signifies that the execution time of the algorithm grows linearly in proportion to the size of the input data (n).
